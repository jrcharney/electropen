# electropen
A local Codepen application

**Electropen** takes all the awesome development of [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) and takes it offline!

## Status

Under Construction - Coming Soon.

## About Electropen

Using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) you can run a webserver locally.  The typical Hello World example run in less than 10 of code on port 3000 when it runs.  However, I'm an HTTPS person (as should you) and want to have my apps run on port 443.

[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) is the framework that should make this app work on multiple operating system (Linux, Mac, and Windows).  If you are using an messaging app like Slack or Discord or if you use RESTful applications like Postman or Insomnia, you've probably used an app that uses Electron.

Electropen uses an Electron framework to test Codepen projects locally.  Or at least in a Codepen-like atmosphere.

## Goals/TODO/Wish stuff.
( ) Multiple "Projects"/"Desktops" sort of like Insomnia or Postman.
( ) Distraction-free mode. (Should only work if you have a Pro account.)
( ) Run test with a Run Button like on JSFiddle instead of running up the memory. (Codepen used to have something like this.)
( ) Library support from [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/).
( ) API building like with [Runkit](https://runkit.com/).
( ) Setting files using [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/).
( ) Semantic versioning with [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

# Options

* Any MySQL stuff would involve using [MyCLI](https://www.mycli.net/) for convenience.
* [Hyper&tm;](https://hyper.is/) is recommended. Let's go all in on our Node.js experience. (That needs to be integrated into Atom!)
* RESTful testing with [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
